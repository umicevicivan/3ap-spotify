## Background story 🗿

You have been hired by a startup company fresh in the music field 🎵 to create a single page app (SPA), MusicBox, which consumes Spotify's [WebApi](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/). The SPA has to be fresh and responsive.

## The🎵Box🎁

The SPA allows the user to search for artists, view artist information, their albums and album tracks. The user can also
see the hottest Spotify releases, previous artist searches and viewed albums. The SPA also allows the user to set a few
preferences.

## Preconditions 🏋

In order to consume the API, the candidate must follow the [authorization guide](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/authorization-guide/).
Besides the WebApi, the [Endpoint reference](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/endpoint-reference/) is a good place to start.

## Assignments 🎓

### 📝 Server

With each request to the API, an access token needs to be provided. MusicBox is a registered application with Spotify and client credentials
(id and secret) will be provided to the candidate upon request. One of the components of MusicBox should be a simple server.
The server should authenticate via the client credentials with Spotify and use the access token.
The server can be developed in any technology stack (e.g. node+express) and should be as simple as possible.

For more information about client credential flow can be found [here](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/authorization-guide/#client-credentials-flow).

### 📝 SPA

The SPA should be developed in React. The SPA should have a fresh and responsive design.
In order to keep things simple, the candidate is asked to use as few third party libraries as possible, but this is not a must.

The starting app is already generated using Angular CLI.
You can find ng create readme in [NG_CREATE_README.md](NG_CREATE_README.md);

### Functionality

#### 🔍 Search

The user can search an [artist](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/search-item/) or artists by first or last name.

#### 🔎 Previous Searches

The user can see their previous artist searches, displaying a predefined number of these. Each artist in the list is selectable.

#### 😎 Artists

Once the user successfully searched for an artist or artists, the user can select an artist
and view the [artist's albums](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/get-artists-albums).

#### 💿 Albums

Albums should display the name, type (one of album, compilation or single) and the appropriate image.
The user can select an album and view the [album's tracks](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/console/get-album-tracks).
Each album has a list of contributors, other artists who worked on the piece. The user can select those as well.

#### 🎼 Tracks

Tracks should display the name, duration, track number and popularity. Tracks can be sorted by the track number or popularity.

#### 📀 New Releases

The user can view the [newest releases](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/console/get-new-releases/).

#### 👓 Recently Viewed

Each time the user selects an album, this album should be stored for easier access later. This list could be displayed as a footer.
The albums should be displayed as a thumbnail image.

#### ⚙ Settings

MusicBox comes with several predefined settings:

- number of visible previous searches
- number of stored previous searches
- number of visible recently viewed albums
- number of stored recently viewed albums
  Changing any of these should reflect the user experience accordingly.

#### 🏆 BONUS

The candidate can provide a new functionality for MusicBox that the client has not requested and based on what Spotify already provides.
The candidate can provide reasonable unit and e2e tests.

### Possible look and feel

**_This is a POSSIBLE look and feel. The candidate is not restricted to follow nor is it requested from the candidate to take this template and solve the assignment with it in mind!!_**
